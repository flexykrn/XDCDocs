# Frequently Asked Questions
## Subnet Node Requirements

- **How many Subnet nodes should I have?**

  Even one node is enough to start the Subnet blockchain! However, for better decentralized security, 3+ nodes are recommended. At least 2/3 of all nodes must be online and honest to mine blocks.

## Development and Testing

- **For testing, should I checkpoint the Subnet to devnet or testnet?**

  It's recommended to use the testnet, as the devnet will be less stable due to frequent development changes.

## Managing Subnet Tokens

- **Where are all the Subnet tokens, and how do I use the Subnet?**

  In XDC-Subnet, all initial tokens are assigned to the Grandmaster wallet (check `keys.json`). You can transfer tokens to any wallet address. For easy transfers, refer to the [Faucet](../using-subnet/faucet.md) documentation.

- **How can I manage Subnet tokens?**

  1. Use the [Subnet Faucet](../using-subnet/faucet.md) to easily transfer Subnet tokens to your users.
  2. Use any Web3 wallet (such as Metamask or OKX wallet), add the Subnet RPC as a custom network then connect to the Subnet and transfer tokens to other addresses.

- **How can I easily give out Subnet tokens to my users?**

  A Faucet server script is provided for you to deploy under `generated/scripts/faucet-server.sh`. Anyone with access to the faucet page can request tokens. Please refer to the [faucet page](../using-subnet/faucet.md) for more details.

## Security and Sensitive Files

- **Which files contain sensitive data and private keys?**

  The following files contain sensitive information and should be stored securely:

  - `common.env`
  - `contract_deploy.env`
  - `keys.json`
  - `subnet*.env`

## Configuration Changes

- **How do I change the Relayer Wallet/Parentchain Wallet?**

  You can update the `common.env` file to change the Relayer key. Refer to the [service configuration documentation](../upgrading-subnet.md#updating-services-configs) for more details.
