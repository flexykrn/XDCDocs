## Blockchain Explorer

You may optionally use an external blocks explorer if you require verbose browsing such as block detail, accounts browsing, contracts browsing. We can recommend [Chainlens-free](https://github.com/web3labs/chainlens-free/tree/master/docker-compose) as one of the solution. Please follow the instructions as the previous link. You only need to pass one of the Subnet's RPC as a variable in the `docker-compose` command, which will most likely be `NODE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8545` or `NODE_ENDPOINT=http://<MAIN_IP>:8545`.
