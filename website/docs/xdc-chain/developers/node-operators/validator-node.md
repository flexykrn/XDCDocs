## Validator Masternode
Validator Masternodes operate and participate in XDC Network’s DPoS consensus engine, validating transactions and block creation. 

## Standby Masternodes
Standby Masternodes (or “Standby Nodes”) are identical in form and function to Validators but do not participate in validating transactions and block creation. These nodes are on standby to fill the role of Validators that drop from network participation.
